<p>Dear <%= @photo.member.display_name %>,</p>
<p>
  Your image "<a href="<%= @photo.get_flickr_url %>"><%= @photo.title %></a>" has no tag. Each week the tag to use is shown in
  the group's status. This photo was taken at <%= @photo.date_taken.to_formatted_s(:long_ordinal) %> in week <%= @photo.week.week_number %>
  so it should have the tag ch<%= @photo.challenge.year.year %>wk<%= @photo.week.week_number %> for the topic <%= @photo.week.subject.strip %>.
</p>
<p>
  It would be very helpful if you would add the tag.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks.
</p>
