Dear <%= @photo.member.display_name %>

Your image "<%= @photo.title %>" (<%= @photo.get_flickr_url %>) has no tag. Each week the tag to use is shown in
the group's status. This photo was taken at <%= @photo.date_taken.to_formatted_s(:long_ordinal) %> in week <%= @photo.week.week_number %>
so it should have the tag ch<%= @photo.challenge.year.year %>wk<%= @photo.week.week_number %> for the topic <%= @photo.week.subject.strip %>.

It would be very helpful if you would add the tag.

Thanks.

Martin
