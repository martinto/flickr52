Dear <%= @photo.member.display_name %>,

Your image "<%= @photo.title %>"  (<%= @photo.get_flickr_url %>) was taken at <%= @photo.date_taken.to_formatted_s(:long_ordinal) %>
which isn't in <%= @photo.challenge.year.year %>.

There are a couple of reasons for this:

 - Your camera isn't set to the correct time and date so please check that.
 - You edited the image and your editor messed up the taken date and time (this is quite common).
   It is possible to fix the date and time in Photoshop or Lightroom and probably in other
   programs, but if you don't know how to do that don't bother.

In either case let me know and I will ignore the date and time.

Martin
